  <ul><h2><a name="P2524_126191"></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><b><i>7.8 Memory Device</i></b></font></h2>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The memory device enables you to add memory devices to the system. You can configure the memory device for emulation of ROM or dynamic memory. You specify the total memory size and the beginning address to which the device should respond.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The memory device can also be configured as a LPC flash device. It currently models 2Mb (SST49LF020A), 4Mb (SST49LF040A), 8Mb (SST49LF080A) and 16Mb (SST49LF160C) flash memory devices. Note that we support two command sequences used generally by flash memory - SST and ATMEL. User should configure the flash memory to the appropriate command sequence to get desired results. The SST49LF160C device uses the ATMEL command sequence while SST49LF020A/SST49LF040A/SST49LF080A use the SST command sequence.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Interfaces</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The memory device has a general-purpose interface that you can connect to any other type of port. No selection is necessary when connecting this memory device to another device.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Initialization and Reset State</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The default state of the device is a RAM<a name="P2533_127204"></a> memory device that is at a base address of 0x00000000 and a size of 4 Gigabytes. The memory has no default content. When an initialization file is specified, the memory device's contents contain the data from that binary file.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After a reset, the memory device reverts back to the initialization file contents.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Contents of a BSD</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The contents of memory, as well as all configuration information, are stored in the BSD.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Configuration Options</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first field of the <i>Memory Configuration</i> tab, shown in <a href="#P2560_129628">Figure 7-17</a>, is the base address of the device in a hexadecimal value. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second field is the total size of the memory device, given in decimal value for the number of 32-Kbyte blocks you would like created (32-Kbyte blocks are used because non-initialized memory is dynamically allocated when addressed in 32-Kbyte chunks).</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third field is the name of the binary file you use to initialize the memory contents. The device initializes memory for the content length of the file. If you specify a 512-Kbyte ROM and use a 256-Kbyte image file, the first 256 Kbytes are initialized. The Init File selection comes with a browse button for easier selection.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Selecting the <i>Read-Only</i> option turns the memory device into a ROM<a name="P2547_128416"></a>. Writes to the device are ignored when the <i>Read-Only</i> option is selected.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Selecting the <i>System BIOS ROM</i> option tells the memory device it is the system BIOS. The memory device only responds to memory address ranges accompanied by a chip-select<a name="P2549_128658"></a> that is generated by the Southbridge device. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Selecting <i>Flash Mode </i>option tells the memory device that it is configured as a flash memory device. There are two command sequences supported by our flash memory device - SST and ATMEL, which can be selected by the drop down below.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Selecting the <i>Memory Address Masking</i> option indicates that the address received by the memory device is masked by a bit mask with the same number of bits as the size of the memory device (e.g., a 256-Kbyte ROM uses an 18-bit mask, or it is masked by 0x003FFFF). This enables the ROM to be remapped dynamically into different memory address ranges in conjunction with the aforementioned chip-select.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Selecting the <i>Initialized unwritten memory to (hex):</i> option initializes otherwise not initialized memory, with a separate field for specifying the byte to use for initialization.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Selecting the <i>Memory is non-cacheable</i> option tells the system if the memory described by the device is non-cacheable.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><a name="P2560_129628"></a>Figure 7-17: Memory Configuration Properties Dialog</b></font></p>

  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Difference from Real Hardware</font></b></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The memory device differs in that it is a generic memory model. When configured as a BIOS ROM, it does not contain flash-specific information that a modern flash ROM<a name="P2563_129873"></a> contains (for programming information purposes).</font></p></ul><p align="left"><a href="help-19.htm#TopOfPage"><img src="images/back.png" alt="Previous Page" border="0"></a><a href="#TopOfPage"><img src="images/top.png" alt="Top Of Page" border="0"></a><a href="help-21.htm#TopOfPage"><img src="images/forward.png" alt="Next Page" border="0"></a></p><!-- TRANSIT - INFOAFTER -->
